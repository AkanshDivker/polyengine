# PolyEngine

PolyEngine is a Python application that takes over the compile process for C/C++ applications. It's main purpose is to apply polymorphic code into designated code segments to protect against reverse engineering and analysis. It also applies secure compile time string encryption.

This is part of a creative term project for the Software Security (COSE451) class at Korea University.

## Getting Started

You can get started by cloning the repository on your desktop. The code should be commented enough to follow along and understand. Please install the necessary Python requirements that are located inside of the `requirements.txt` file.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.7 to be installed. Please ensure the required modules in `requirements.txt` are installed.

### Usage
In order to use the module, cd into the `polyengine` directory and simply start the script by calling `python polyengine.py` in your terminal. Please ensure the required settings listed in `config.ini` are setup and verified. PolyEngine will operate in that directory and use the settings specified in the configuration file.
