# PolyEngine

PolyEngine is a Python application that takes over the compile process for C/C++ applications. It's main purpose is to apply polymorphic code into designated code segments to protect against reverse engineering and analysis. It also applies secure compile time string encryption.

This is part of a term project for the Software Security (COSE451) class at Korea University.

**Coverage**
- Code obfuscation
- Polymorphic code
- Compile time string encryption
